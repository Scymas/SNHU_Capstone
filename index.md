You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Scymas/SNHU_Capstone/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.


### Test

``python

def MD5ConversionFunc(userPassword, Type):
    original = userPassword
    userType = Type

    hashed = hashlib.md5(original.encode())  # uses hashlib to encode hashed password

    hashed2 = hashed.hexdigest()  # returns the digest for the hashed pass; returns as string containing only -
    # hexadecimals

    passCheck(hashed2, userType)

    return hashed2  # Returns hashed password for unit testing

### Jekyll Themes
